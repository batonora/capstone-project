    <div class="about-me">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Nora Bato, I was born is Harkakötöny, which is a small village in Southern Hungary on October 19, 1996. I always had liked to do creative activities, like crafting, painting and drawing. In my teenage years I made a lot of website for fun, I really liked to make different designs. In the secondary school my favourite subject was math, so I decided to learn to an engineer.</p>
      <p>In 2015 I started to learn to electrical engineer in Budapest University of Technology and Economics, so I moved to Budapest (which is a capital to Hungary) and I live here since then. </p>
      <p>During my studies I fell in love with programming. In 2019 I started to work as a software engineer (and after as a DevOps engineer) at a multi, but it was not enough for my creative soul so during my master degree I started to learn mobile development, and later to a web developer.</p>
